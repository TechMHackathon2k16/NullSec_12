# OpenSchool

This is an application which can be used by everyone , from your grandma to your techi relative (just kidding that must be you if you are seeing this :) ) to open their own School without any of the extra things such as infrastructure costs of a building or buying a huge server for hosting an openMOOC.

to build this project the steps are

git clone https://github.com/TechMHackathon2k16/NullSec_12.git

cd NullSec_12

npm install

npm start

visit localhost:3000 or <your ip here>:3000

username :teacher
password :any
for login as a teacher.
Use any other combo for student login.
P.S. this project uses the NodeJS V6.0.0+ and also uses WebRTC which is supported in most latest browsers
